# ELogin into AWS and implement identity management (Amazon IAM) foryour team.

## Aim:
To understand and implement identity and access management (IAM) using Amazon IAM for
secure user access control. This includes:
● Creating IAM users
● Creating IAM groups and attaching policies
● Assigning users to groups
● Applying the principle of least privilege

## Pre-requites:
```
1. Background:
Identity and Access Management (IAM) in AWS enables you to securely manage
access to AWS services and resources. IAM allows the creation of users, groups, roles, and policies
that define permissions.
Key Concepts:
● User: An entity representing a person or application
● Group: A collection of users with common permissions
● Policy: A JSON document that defines permissions
● Role: Temporary access permissions for services or users
2. Tools Required:
● AWS Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
● Internet Browser
● IAM administrative access
● Team member email IDs (optional, for sharing credentials)
3. Procedure:
Step 1: Log in to AWS Console
● URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
● Sign in using root or IAM user with administrator privileges.
Step 2: Navigate to IAM Dashboard
● In the AWS Console search bar, type IAM and select IAM.
● The IAM dashboard appears showing user summary, MFA status, and best
practices.
Step 3: Create IAM Group
● Click on User groups > Create group
● Enter a group name: DevTeam
● Attach a policy (e.g., AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess) or custom policy.
● Click Create group
Step 4: Create IAM Users
● Go to Users > Add users
● Enter username (e.g., john.doe, alice.dev)
● Select Provide user access to AWS Management Console
● Choose Autogenerated password or custom password
● Require password reset on first login (recommended)
● Assign user to the group created in step 3 (e.g., DevTeam)
Step 5: Review and Create Users
● Confirm all user details
● Download or copy the credentials securely
Step 6: Login as IAM User (Test Access)
● Use the IAM user sign-in link (e.g.,
https://your-account-id.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)
● Login with newly created IAM credentials
Step 7: Test IAM User Permissions
● Attempt to access EC2 dashboard
● Validate that the user has read-only access (based on policy)
● Attempt to launch or terminate an instance (should be denied)
```

## Result:
IAM users and groups were successfully created and managed using Amazon IAM. Identity
management was tested with proper permission controls, following least privilege principles.
